I knew from the start I wanted to combine my CS50 final project
with information that I've learned in another course. After a
meeting with a HealthLeads worker in Boston, I learned that a
huge problem with impoverished in the Boston area is just a lack
of knowledge of the resources available. It was this that made me
come to realize how much of an impact this idea of personalized
social care could have on individuals. I also thought it would be
a good idea to add the forum, since even this process isn't
perfect. Crowd sourced social care creates a sense shared ownership
of those in our community.
