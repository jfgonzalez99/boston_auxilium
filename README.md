# Welcome to Boston Auxillium

A website that connects users with community
resources in the Boston area catered just for them. In order to get
the website started make sure you start by typing "cd project" into
your control terminal and performflask run. When you open the website,
users are greeted with a login page. To register an account, press
register in the top right corner. Once you've entered a proper username
and password, you're taken to a questionnaire that will determine which
community resources are picked for you. Once you're done with that
you're taken to the resources that were picked for you. If you have
any questions about any of your resources, there is an anonmymous public
forum that you can ask questions in and respond to other users.
